## Introduction
"NeuroVista" is a Web App, built with the objective of detecting Parkinson's disease accurately. 

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection of the disease can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns in patient data that indicate the presence of Parkinson's Disease.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thecansin/parkinsons-data-set).
